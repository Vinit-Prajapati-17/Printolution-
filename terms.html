                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing and using Printolution's services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our services.</p>

                <h2>2. Services</h2>
                <p>Printolution provides printing and design services including but not limited to business cards, brochures, packaging, wedding cards, and promotional materials. All services are subject to availability and acceptance by Printolution.</p>

                <h2>3. Orders and Quotations</h2>
                <p>All quotations are valid for 30 days from the date of issue. Orders are confirmed upon receipt of advance payment as specified in the quotation. Printolution reserves the right to refuse any order at its discretion.</p>

                <h2>4. Pricing and Payment</h2>
                <p>Prices are quoted in Indian Rupees (INR) and are subject to change without notice. Payment terms will be specified in each quotation. Late payments may incur additional charges. We accept payment via bank transfer, UPI, and other specified methods.</p>

                <h2>5. Design and Artwork</h2>
                <p>Clients are responsible for providing print-ready artwork or approving designs before production. Printolution is not liable for errors in client-supplied artwork. Design revisions beyond the agreed scope may incur additional charges.</p>

                <h2>6. Proofs and Approvals</h2>
                <p>Digital proofs will be provided for client approval before printing. Once approved, Printolution is not responsible for any errors that were present in the approved proof. Changes after approval may result in additional costs and delays.</p>

                <h2>7. Production and Delivery</h2>
                <p>Production timelines are estimates and may vary based on order complexity and volume. Printolution will make reasonable efforts to meet agreed deadlines but is not liable for delays beyond our control. Delivery charges are additional unless otherwise stated.</p>

                <h2>8. Quality and Color Matching</h2>
                <p>We strive for the highest quality in all our products. However, slight variations in color between digital proofs and printed materials may occur due to differences in printing processes and materials. A variance of ±10% in color matching is considered acceptable industry standard.</p>

                <h2>9. Returns and Refunds</h2>
                <p>Custom-printed materials are non-returnable unless there is a manufacturing defect or error on our part. Claims must be made within 7 days of delivery with photographic evidence. Refunds or reprints will be provided at Printolution's discretion.</p>

                <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>Clients retain ownership of their original content and designs. Printolution retains the right to use completed projects in our portfolio and marketing materials unless otherwise agreed in writing. Clients must ensure they have rights to all content provided for printing.</p>

                <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>Printolution's liability is limited to the value of the specific order in question. We are not liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages arising from the use of our services.</p>

                <h2>12. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>Orders may be cancelled before production begins with a full refund minus any design fees. Once production has started, cancellation fees will apply based on the stage of completion.</p>

                <h2>13. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>We respect client confidentiality and will not disclose project details to third parties without permission, except as required by law.</p>

                <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Mumbai, Maharashtra.</p>

                <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>Printolution reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.</p>
